<p>The Window Menu can be opened by:</p>

<p><ul><li>Clicking the middle mouse button on the window title bar, see <a href="VirtuaWin_SetupDialog.htm">Setup Dialog</a>'s Enable middle button window menu activation setting. </p></li>

<p><li>Binding the <b><i>UI: Open compact window menu</i></b> command to a hotkey and pressing this hotkey while a window has input focus.</p></li></ul>

<p>The window menu is used to control and configure the current window, i.e the window currently with the input focus. The menu contains the following items:</p>

<p><ul><li><b><i>Dismiss Window</i></b>: If the current window is only being temporarily show (for example the window list 'Show' feature was used to display it, also see option On hidden window activation) it will be moved back to its original desktop, otherwise the window will be minimized.</p></li>

<p><li><b><i>Push to Bottom</i></b>: Pushes the window to the back of the desktop, i.e. under every other window.</p></li>

<p><li><b><i>Stop Managing</i></b>: Forces VirtuaWin to not manage the current window, this item is only available if the window is currently being managed.</p></li>

<p><li><b><i>Always Show</i></b>: Toggles whether the current window is visible on all desktops or just the current one. </p></li>

<p><li><b><i>Gather</i></b>: moves all the windows created by the current window's process onto the current desktop.</p></li>

<p><li><b><i>Move to Next</i></b>: Moves the current window to next desktop; this command will fail if the current desktop is the last desktop and Enable desktop wrapping is disabled.</p></li>
