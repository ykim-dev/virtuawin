<p><h2>Install/Uninstall </h2></p>

<p>The installation and un-installation of VirtuaWin is fully automated.</p>

<p>To install run <span style="font-family: monospace">VirtuWin_setup_&lt;version&gt;.exe</span> or, if wide character support is required, run <span style="font-family: monospace">VirtuWin_Unicode_setup_&lt;version&gt;.exe</span>. For uninstalling, quit VirtuaWin and choose the uninstall icon, however, if you add custom icons or modules, the un-install process will not be able to remove the “icons” or “modules” folder – this must be done manually.</p>

<p>VirtuaWin does not add or require any registry keys to run, only the required uninstall program registry keys are added by the installer. Nothing else is added to your system, all VirtuaWin files are placed in the installation directory of VirtuaWin.</p>
