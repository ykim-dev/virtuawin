<p><h2>Locking or Hiding Desktops </h2></p>

<p>As applications run independently of VirtuaWin, a 'locked desktop' concept is flawed and cannot be made secure. For example, an unwanted guest could use the task manager to suspend the VirtuaWin process and then use any window restore tool (like WinList) to access the hidden windows. From a security perspective, the only thing a locked desktop achieves is to prove you have something to hide!</p>

<p>A more suitable approach would be 'stealth', what is not seen is unlikely to be found. A hidden desktop is no more secure than a locked desktop when someone else knows it exists, so don't tell anyone!</p>

<p>VirtuaWin can be configured to support 1 or more hidden desktops by assigning a desktop access hotkey to a desktop that is outside of the main Desktop Layout size. For example, if a 2 by 2 layout is used, assigning a hotkey to desktop 8 will give you direct access to this desktop yet the desktop and its contents will be hidden in every other aspect.</p>

<p>To configure a hidden desktop, use the main VirtuaWin Setup to change your Desktop Layout so that your required hidden desktop becomes part of the layout, e.g. to enable desktop 8 change to a 4 by 2 layout. Change to this new desktop and use Setup to assign a hotkey, make sure the hotkey is not something you could accidentally type and don't forget it! Last, restore the desktop layout so that the hidden desktop is outside this range (i.e. back to a 2 by 2 layout) and check you can still access the hidden desktop using your assigned hotkey.</p>

<p>As a hidden desktop will not appear on any VirtuaWin menu, moving a window to it must be done by either making the window sticky or by going to the desktop and using the Window List menu to Assign the window.</p>

<p>Hiding desktops in VirtuaWin is deliberately low profile, the less this feature is known the more secure it is.</p>
